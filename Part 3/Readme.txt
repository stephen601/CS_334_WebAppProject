Stephen Villanueva: Manamgent and login
Noah Caulfield: Index, store, checkout, and payment
Stephen Washington:Checkout and payment, webhost file setup, readme, excution pdf. 

              Note: Initial checkout and payment was setup to use with json and gather customer orders from the index page, by recieving the order and quanties. 
                    A different implementation was chosen, instead. Checkout and payment by Stephen Washington was removed due to new implementation of checkout
                    and payment being done on the index page. The checkout html, css, and js files will be in the part 3 folder, as the work was done for part 3.
                    Checkout files will not be a part of the website for part 3.
