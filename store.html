            <p>Albuquerque Softserve is a beloved ice cream shop that has been locally owned and operated in northern NM since the 1970s. The shop was founded by a husband and wife team who had a passion for creating delicious, high-quality soft serve ice cream.</p>
            <p> Over the years, Albuquerque Softserve has become a fixture in the community, known for its wide variety of flavors and commitment to using only the freshest, locally sourced ingredients. Customers often line up around the block to enjoy their favorite flavors, from classic vanilla and chocolate to unique creations like green chile and pi√±on nut.</p>
            <p> Despite its success, Albuquerque Softserve has remained true to its roots as a family-owned business. The founders' children and grandchildren now help run the shop, and many of the original recipes are still used today. Visitors can enjoy their ice cream in the cozy, vintage-style shop or take it to go and explore the beautiful surrounding landscape of northern New Mexico.</p>
            <p>With its delicious flavors and deep roots in the community, Albuquerque Softserve is a true local institution and a must-visit destination for ice cream lovers in the area.</p>
